# L4D2 Competitive Stripper Rework

## About:
This repository is for reworking the Stripper:Source map changes for competitive L4D2 from scratch, ensuring full compatibility with the map changes added to the game by The Last Stand update.

The aim is to re-implement improved versions of historical changes, unify map modifications across servers and configs, and providing a basic template that already includes all necessary fixes and improvements, which can easily be added to or modified by any server owners and config developers.

While many of the changes will appear very similar to those included in previous versions of competitive Stripper:Source files and is heavily inspired by them, the goal is to re-create everything from the ground up to ensure the best possible implementation of the changes.

## Usage:
Any server owner or config developer is allowed to freely use this as a base for their own Stripper:Source modifications _**as long as credit is provided**_ to this repository.

All changes are tested and implemented with the latest version of Stripper:Source only.
* **Version:** 1.2.2 (hg82) (updated 2011-04-15)
* **AlliedModders:** https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=39439
* **Source:** https://github.com/alliedmodders/stripper-source
* **Documentation:** https://www.bailopan.net/stripper/

## Compatibility:
In order to ensure full compatibility with the changes provided by this rework, it is highly recommended that servers **DO NOT** load _clip_removal.smx_ with configs that uses this rework. This plugin is flawed and does apply changes to both versus rounds. All functionality of this plugin can also be achieved with Stripper.

## Documentation:
A complete changelog and documentation of changes will be available on the **[wiki](https://github.com/Derpduck/L4D2-Comp-Stripper-Rework/wiki)**. Where possible screenshots will also be available.
